# bp_refs v0008

- mode: `manual_refactor`
- created_by: `human`
- created_at: `2026-06-18T00:26:47+00:00`
- parent: `v0007`

## Rationale

Refactor refs from a flat scratchpad list into typed Evidence ledger roles. refs.md owns the shared model and safety projection; topic BPs classify their domain evidence; submission_terminal checks the completed ledger before submit.

## Rollback

Retire this version to fall back to v0007, or issue a new manual_refactor version with adjusted ledger wording.
